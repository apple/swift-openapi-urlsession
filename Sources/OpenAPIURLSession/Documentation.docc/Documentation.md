# ``OpenAPIURLSession``

Send HTTP requests to the server using URLSession from the Foundation framework. 

## Overview

A client transport that uses the [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) type from the [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) framework to perform HTTP operations.

Use the transport with client code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).

### Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-urlsession",
    exact: "1.0.0-alpha.1"
),
```

Note that this repository does not have a 1.0 tag yet, so the API is not stable.

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIURLSession` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIURLSession", package: "swift-openapi-urlsession"),
],
```

Then, to get started, check out ``URLSessionTransport``.

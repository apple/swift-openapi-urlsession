    exact: "1.0.0-alpha.1"
),
```

Note that this repository does not have a 1.0 tag yet, so the API is not stable.

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIURLSession` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIURLSession", package: "swift-openapi-urlsession"),
],
```

Then, to get started, check out ``URLSessionTransport``.

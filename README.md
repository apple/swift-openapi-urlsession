## Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-urlsession",
    .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0")
),
```

Note that this repository does not have a 1.0 tag yet, so the API is not stable.

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIURLSession` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIURLSession", package: "swift-openapi-urlsession"),
],
```

Then, to get started, check out `URLSessionTransport`.
